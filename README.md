# What is this?

This is an API wrapper for https://enka.network in Java.
<br> At the time of writing, we only had the option to use a Wrapper for JS, TS, PY hence why I made this :)

If you want to view the change log, please refer to the [CHANGELOG.md].

## As of version 4.2, all docs have been rewritten. For Installation and examples please refer to http://enka-docs.kazury.me.
